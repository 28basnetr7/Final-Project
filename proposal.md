After discussing with the group, me and my group members planned to name this game a "Chicken Running the Road" for the final project. The game that we planned to create for the final project describes as the python language game where players help a character cross obstacles like cars or logs. The goal is to reach the other side without getting hit. The game gets harder as obstacles move faster or appear more often. We used simple graphics and controls, created with tools like Pygame. The game that we named and created "Chicken Running the Road" is about guiding a character safely across moving obstacles like chicken and logs. The game gets harder as you progress, with faster or more frequent obstacles. It includes collision detection to end the game if the character gets hit and a scoring system to track progress. Built with Pygame, it has simple controls and fun, interactive gameplay.
